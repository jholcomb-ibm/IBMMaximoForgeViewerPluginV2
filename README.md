IBM Maximo - Autodesk Forge Viewer Plugin Version 2

This repository contains the source code for the IBM Maximo - Autodesk Forge Viewer Plugin Version 2.  A new version was created for ease of use.  It is designed to be used with fixes that have been added as of December 16, 2019 into the Maximo 7.6.0.9 hotfix, Maximo 7.6.1.1 hotfix, and 7.6.1.2 and future releases.

To utilize the plugin without having to use a development environment, make sure that you have applied the hotfixes mentioned above, or are using Maximo 7.6.1.2 or later.  Copy the directories under the bin directory into your Maximo root directory (back up your Maximo files first, just in case).  You should then rebuild your maximo.ear file, redeploy it in your application server, and restart Maximo.
